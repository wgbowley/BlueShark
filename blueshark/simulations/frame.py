Description:
    Executes a single FEMM simulation frame for a configured motor instance.

    Responsibilities:
    - Opens FEMM and loads the motor's `.fem` file
    - Steps the motor and applies appropriate phase currents
    - Runs FEMM analysis, with retry logic on failure
    - Computes post-processing outputs as requested
    - Closes FEMM and deletes the temporary `.ans` file
